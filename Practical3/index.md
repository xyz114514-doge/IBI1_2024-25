## Welcome 
My name is Xiang Yingzhe. 
I am an IBI1 student at the Zhejiang University - University of Edinburgh (ZJE) Institute.
I have a wide range of hobbies, like playing the piano, daily habit of using music to relieve pressure. I also like football. As a member of the ZJE football team, I participated in the Trailblazer Cup football match with the team. Physical training and collective cooperation make me pay more attention to persistence and tolerance. In addition, I served as the fourth debater in the 8th campus White Horse Cup debate competition, which broadened the speculative dimension when breaking down the debate topics, and was also lucky to be awarded the best debater of the year.
In terms of work, since college, I have actively participated in the affairs of the Quality Development Center of the Communist Party of China and the League branch secretary of the class. The above is my main information.
